This is a repository for the programms I do in assembly. The programms are written for the architecture x86_64 in intel syntax. I used gcc in ubuntu for testing the code.
Printing and scanning values from the terminal are made using the extern C printf and scanf functions

The first programm I made is a simple bubble sort implementation without optimizations, that is, comparing all the elements with the previous for n times.
